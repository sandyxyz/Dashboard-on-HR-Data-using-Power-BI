# Dashboard-on-HR-Data-using-Power-BI

An HR dataset typically refers to a collection of data related to Human Resources (HR) within an organization. This dataset contains information about employees, job positions, salaries, performance evaluations, recruitment, training, and other relevant HR metrics. It serves as the foundation for HR analytics, reporting, and decision-making processes within a company.

It's essential to handle HR data with utmost care and ensure compliance with data protection and privacy regulations, especially when dealing with sensitive information like employee personal details.

The HR dataset is a valuable resource for HR professionals and management, as it enables them to gain insights into various aspects of the workforce, identify trends, make informed decisions, and devise strategies to enhance employee satisfaction, retention, and overall organizational performance. Additionally, with the help of tools like Power BI (as mentioned in the previous response), HR professionals can create visualizations and dashboards to present the data in a meaningful and actionable manner.
